About
-----
     
This program is meant as a drop in replacement for your command line
ftp client when used by Emacs to transparently access FTP
servers. When used with a custom, non ftp, port it will emulate an FTP
server and client that makes Emacs think your Media Wiki site is an
FTP server with your Wiki Articles as files. Otherwise it will pass
control to your regular FTP client allowing you to use it regularly.


Requirements and Installation
-----------------------------

Mediawikiftp works with a vanilla Python installation version 2.3 or
better. To install just copy it to a directory on your $PATH. Make
sure it's executable. To configure it in Emacs add this to your .emacs
file:

(custom-set-variables
  ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
  ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
  ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
  ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 '(ange-ftp-ftp-program-name "/path/to/mediawikiftp"))

Or use

   M-x customize-group RET ange-ftp

to do so automatically.

TODO
----

- The BASE AUTH and Proxy functionality remains untested right now.
- There's probably half a ton of bugs in there
- Add more and better comments
